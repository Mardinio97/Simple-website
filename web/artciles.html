    <h1 id="ftitle">How To Become A DJ</h1>
    <p>
      When you’re learning to DJ, you’re learning to match your own musical
      expressions with the desires of an audience. It isn’t just matching beats,
      or scratching over songs. It’s about being observant, empathic, and
      reactive. Contrary to popular belief, learning to DJ is not an easy route
      to overnight success. This takes work, and hustle, and time. It’s not
      difficult to start. But it is difficult to stand out, and to be
      exceptional.

    <h1 id="stitle">The 3 diffient types of DJ´s</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2 id="ttitle">Club DJs</h2>
        <p>
          Every club has a different feel, reputation, and audience… which means
          they vary in what’s expected from their musical selection. Normally,
          the club DJ’s job is maintaining a moving dance floor. Club DJs may
          perform long blends (called transitions) between songs, or some other
          trickery to keep people’s feet moving. When a DJ performs at a venue
          regularly or permanently, they’re called a resident DJ. They must know
          how to ramp the energy up and down, maintaining the balance between an
          active dance floor and a busy bar. “Club DJs” who have built a
          following may also perform at bars, music venues, festivals, etc.

        <h2>Mobile DJs</h2>
        <p>
          These DJs perform at your wedding, set the tone for your corporate
          event, or provide a memorable prom party. Often the entrepreneurial
          type, mobile DJs have lots to keep track of. They may be solely
          responsible for the setup and teardown of equipment, planning the
          show, managing the crowd, and making any announcements. This kind of
          DJ may need to be comfortable taking requests (and sometimes even
          entire playlists), speaking into a microphone, and investing in sound
          equipment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Radio DJs</h2>
        <p>
          The entire concept of DJing owes it’s origins to radio. The radio DJ’s
          job varies greatly, from the person who announces the weather between
          songs, to full-on music curation. While many corporate radio DJs have
          lost control over the music, the art lives on in podcast format.
