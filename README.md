1. Did you know and/or had used HTML and CSS before this assignment?
   Actually it is my first time to start utilising the HTML and the CSS although back in summer 2020 I used to watch tutorila video about web desgining so at least I have a basic idea

2. Brifly exaplain, with your own words, about HTML to a person who have never heard of it before
   So basicaslly the HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is a makeup langauge to construct web pages , it contains prredefined elements that helps to sturcture the web page.

3.Brifly exaplain, with your own words, about CSS to a person who have never heard of it before.
The CSS is refered to (Cascading Style Sheets) It is styling langauge that is utilized to style the web pages, CSS helps to give a better design and displays the HTML elememts in a good layout.

4. Elaborate on the importance of keeping HTML (markup and content) and CSS (style and layout) as two separate items. Is it important and in that case why? Can it be completely separated or do they smoehow depend on eachother?
   The HTML and the CSS are two significant sourcses which needs to be used to build up web pages and web Applications ,I believe that it is not important to separete them apart, although the HTML could stand by its own , but as a result the layout of the webpage would not be good looking since it lacks the CSS. So as result HTMl and CSS depend of each other since they are basis of creating web applications & websites.
